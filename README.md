# audio-to-text

Here  i used the three libraries to extract the  text from the audio
 * Whisper library with spacy , and also we can implement it with the gp4 version to parse the text
 * Assembly ai library
 * pydub speech recognition library 

**Whispher Library**
 it is taking more time to extract the text
**Assembly ai Library**
It takes less as time as compares to the whisper library

**Pydub speech Recognition**
It takes less time as compares  to the above 2 libraries,
This is giving the text as op in 5 sec with the parsing

**To run the program**

python manage.py runserver / for the django project

**TO run the files of main and main 1 
Use "uvicorn main:app --reload" & "uvicorn main1:app --reload"**
